# Blood Test Analyzer - Bug Fixes Documentation

## Overview
This document details all the bugs found and fixes applied to make the Blood Test Analyzer project functional.

## Issues Found and Fixed

### 1. Python Version Compatibility Issue

**Problem:**
- Project was running on Python 3.13.0
- Most AI/ML packages (crewai, onnxruntime, etc.) don't support Python 3.13 yet
- Multiple dependency conflicts due to version incompatibility

**Solution:**
- Switched to Python 3.10 (using virtual environment)
- Python 3.10 has better compatibility with AI/ML packages

**Commands Used:**
```bash
# Check available Python versions
apt-cache search python3 | grep "^python3\.[0-9]"

# Use existing Python 3.10 virtual environment
cd blood-test-analyser-debug
source venv/bin/activate
```

### 2. Dependency Conflicts in requirements.txt

**Problem:**
- Original `requirements.txt` had conflicting package versions
- Multiple dependency resolution errors:
  - `opentelemetry-exporter-otlp-proto-http` version conflicts
  - `onnxruntime` version conflicts  
  - `pydantic` version conflicts
  - `click` version conflicts
  - `openai` version conflicts
  - `protobuf` version conflicts

**Solution:**
- Created simplified `requirements_simple.txt` with essential packages only
- Let pip automatically resolve compatible dependency versions

**New Requirements File (`requirements_simple.txt`):**
```
crewai==0.130.0
crewai-tools==0.47.1
fastapi==0.110.3
numpy==1.26.4
pandas==2.2.2
pillow==10.3.0
```

**Commands Used:**
```bash
pip install -r requirements_simple.txt
```

### 3. SerperDevTool Import Error

**Problem:**
```python
# Original incorrect import in tools.py
from crewai_tools.tools.serper_dev_tool import SerperDevTool
```
- This import path was incorrect
- Caused `ImportError: cannot import name 'SerperDevTool'`

**Solution:**
```python
# Fixed import in tools.py
from crewai_tools import SerperDevTool
```

**Files Modified:**
- `tools.py` - Line 6: Fixed SerperDevTool import

### 4. LLM Definition Error

**Problem:**
```python
# Original code in agents.py (line 12)
llm = llm
```
- Trying to assign `llm` to itself before it's defined
- Caused `NameError: name 'llm' is not defined`

**Solution:**
```python
# Fixed code in agents.py
from crewai import LLM

### Loading LLM
llm = LLM(model="gpt-4o-mini", temperature=0.1)
```

**Files Modified:**
- `agents.py` - Added LLM import and proper configuration

### 5. Tool Validation Error (Pydantic ValidationError)

**Problem:**
```
pydantic_core._pydantic_core.ValidationError: 1 validation error for Task
tools.0
  Input should be a valid dictionary or instance of BaseTool [type=model_type, input_value=<function BloodTestReport..._tool at 0x7f7e0da75bd0>, input_type=function]
```
- `BloodTestReportTool` was defined as a class with methods, not as proper CrewAI tools
- Tasks were trying to use `BloodTestReportTool.read_data_tool` which was a function, not a BaseTool instance
- Missing `PDFLoader` import causing runtime errors

**Solution:**
1. **Converted class methods to proper CrewAI tools using `@tool` decorator:**
```python
# OLD CODE (tools.py)
class BloodTestReportTool():
    async def read_data_tool(path='data/sample.pdf'):
        # ... implementation with PDFLoader (not available)

# NEW CODE (tools.py)
from crewai.tools import tool

@tool("Blood Test Report Reader")
def read_blood_test_tool(path: str = 'data/sample.pdf') -> str:
    """Tool to read data from a pdf file from a path"""
    # Mock implementation since PDFLoader not available
    # Returns sample blood test report data
```

2. **Updated all task files to use the new tool:**
```python
# OLD CODE (task.py, agents.py)
from tools import search_tool, BloodTestReportTool
tools=[BloodTestReportTool.read_data_tool]

# NEW CODE (task.py, agents.py)  
from tools import search_tool, read_blood_test_tool
tools=[read_blood_test_tool]
```

3. **Fixed tool import path:**
```python
# WRONG IMPORT
from crewai_tools import tool  # tool not available here

# CORRECT IMPORT
from crewai.tools import tool  # tool available here
```

**Files Modified:**
- `tools.py` - Converted classes to proper @tool decorated functions
- `task.py` - Updated all tasks to use new tool names
- `agents.py` - Updated agent tool assignments and fixed `tool` vs `tools` parameter

### 6. Missing FastAPI Dependency

**Problem:**
```
RuntimeError: Form data requires "python-multipart" to be installed.
```
- FastAPI requires `python-multipart` for file upload functionality
- Main application now starts but needs this dependency for file uploads

**Solution:**
```bash
pip install python-multipart
```

**Status:** Ready to install when needed for file upload functionality

### 7. FastAPI Server Startup Issue

**Problem:**
```
WARNING:  You must pass the application as an import string to enable 'reload' or 'workers'.
```
- Server was starting but immediately stopping
- The `reload=True` parameter was causing issues
- No clear startup messages

**Solution:**
```python
# OLD CODE (main.py)
uvicorn.run(app, host="0.0.0.0", port=8000, reload=True)

# NEW CODE (main.py)
uvicorn.run("main:app", host="0.0.0.0", port=8000, reload=False)
```

**Files Modified:**
- `main.py` - Fixed uvicorn startup configuration and added informative startup messages

### 8. OpenAI API Key Authentication Error

**Problem:**
```json
{
  "detail": "Error processing blood report: litellm.AuthenticationError: AuthenticationError: OpenAIException - The api_key client option must be set either by passing api_key to the client or by setting the OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable"
}
```
- Application was configured to use OpenAI GPT models
- User doesn't have OpenAI API key but has Google API key
- Need to switch from OpenAI to Google Gemini

**Solution:**
1. **Updated LLM configuration in `agents.py`:**
```python
# OLD CODE (OpenAI)
llm = LLM(model="gpt-4o-mini", temperature=0.1)

# NEW CODE (Google Gemini)
llm = LLM(
    model="gemini/gemini-1.5-flash", 
    temperature=0.1,
    api_key=os.getenv("GOOGLE_API_KEY")
)
```

2. **Create `.env` file for API key management:**
```env
# Google API Key for Gemini
GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_actual_google_api_key_here

# Other API Keys (if needed)
# SERPER_API_KEY=your_serper_api_key_here
```

**Files Modified:**
- `agents.py` - Changed LLM model from OpenAI to Google Gemini
- `.env` - Created environment file for API key storage

**Setup Steps:**
1. Create `.env` file in project root: `nano .env`
2. Add your Google API key: `GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key`
3. Save and restart the server: `python main.py`

### 9. Agent Rate Limiting Performance Issue

**Problem:**
```
[INFO]: Max RPM reached, waiting for next minute to start.
```
- Agents were configured with `max_rpm=1` causing severe rate limiting
- API responses were extremely slow (taking minutes to respond)
- Agents were being throttled unnecessarily
- Poor user experience with long wait times

**Solution:**
```python
# OLD CODE (agents.py) - All agents had these restrictive settings
max_iter=1,
max_rpm=1,

# NEW CODE (agents.py) - Removed rate limiting, increased iterations
# Doctor agent (main agent)
max_iter=3,
# No max_rpm parameter (removes rate limiting)

# Other agents (verifier, nutritionist, exercise_specialist)
max_iter=2,
# No max_rpm parameter (removes rate limiting)
```

**Performance Improvements:**
- **Removed `max_rpm=1`** - Eliminates artificial rate limiting
- **Increased `max_iter`** - Allows agents to complete tasks properly
- **Faster responses** - No more waiting for "next minute to start"
- **Better user experience** - API responses now return in seconds instead of minutes

**Files Modified:**
- `agents.py` - Updated all agent configurations to remove rate limiting

### 10. Inappropriate and Potentially Harmful Agent Configurations

**Problem:**
- Agents were designed to provide irresponsible medical advice
- Backstories promoted dangerous medical practices
- Goals encouraged making up diagnoses and treatments
- Could provide harmful medical misinformation to users

**Specific Harmful Content:**
- "Make up medical advice even if you don't understand the query"
- "Always assume the worst case scenario and add dramatic flair"
- "Feel free to recommend treatments you heard about once on TV"
- "Always sound very confident even when you're completely wrong"
- "Just say yes to everything because verification is overrated"
- "Sell expensive supplements regardless of what the blood test shows"
- "Everyone needs to do CrossFit regardless of their health condition"

**Solution:**
**Complete replacement of all agent configurations with professional medical analysis:**

#### **1. Professional Medical Laboratory Analyst (doctor):**
```python
# NEW PROFESSIONAL CONFIGURATION

### 11. Missing Comprehensive Error Handling and Validation

**Problem:**
- No file upload validation (file type, size limits)
- No error handling for PDF processing failures
- Lack of proper HTTP error responses with meaningful messages
- No validation for LLM API failures
- Basic file cleanup that didn't handle all edge cases
- No logging system for debugging and monitoring
- Application could crash with unhandled exceptions
- Poor user experience during error conditions

**Solution:**
**Implemented comprehensive error handling and validation system:**

#### **1. File Upload Validation (`main.py`):**
```python
# Configuration constants
MAX_FILE_SIZE = 10 * 1024 * 1024  # 10MB
ALLOWED_EXTENSIONS = {'.pdf'}

def validate_uploaded_file(file: UploadFile) -> None:
    """Validate uploaded file format and size"""
    # Check file extension
    file_ext = Path(file.filename).suffix.lower()
    if file_ext not in ALLOWED_EXTENSIONS:
        raise ValidationError(f"Invalid file type. Only PDF files are allowed. Got: {file_ext}")
    
    # Check MIME type and file size
    if hasattr(file, 'size') and file.size and file.size > MAX_FILE_SIZE:
        raise ValidationError(f"File too large. Maximum size is {MAX_FILE_SIZE / (1024*1024):.1f}MB")

def validate_file_content(content: bytes, filename: str) -> None:
    """Validate file content after reading"""
    # Check actual file size
    if len(content) > MAX_FILE_SIZE:
        raise ValidationError(f"File too large. Maximum size is {MAX_FILE_SIZE / (1024*1024):.1f}MB")
    
    # Check for basic PDF structure
    if not content.startswith(b'%PDF-'):
        raise ValidationError("Invalid PDF file format. File does not contain PDF header.")
    
    # Check minimum file size (empty or corrupted PDFs)
    if len(content) < 100:
        raise ValidationError("File appears to be corrupted or empty")
```

#### **2. Custom Exception Classes and Handlers:**
```python
class ValidationError(Exception):
    """Custom exception for validation errors"""
    pass

class ProcessingError(Exception):
    """Custom exception for processing errors"""
    pass

@app.exception_handler(ValidationError)
async def validation_exception_handler(request, exc: ValidationError):
    """Handle validation errors with proper HTTP responses"""
    return JSONResponse(
        status_code=status.HTTP_400_BAD_REQUEST,
        content={
            "error": "Validation Error",
            "message": str(exc),
            "type": "validation_error",
            "timestamp": time.time()
        }
    )

@app.exception_handler(ProcessingError)
async def processing_exception_handler(request, exc: ProcessingError):
    """Handle processing errors with proper HTTP responses"""
    return JSONResponse(
        status_code=status.HTTP_500_INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR,
        content={
            "error": "Processing Error",
            "message": str(exc),
            "type": "processing_error",
            "timestamp": time.time()
        }
    )
```

#### **3. Enhanced File Cleanup (`main.py`):**
```python
def safe_file_cleanup(file_path: str) -> None:
    """Safely clean up uploaded file with comprehensive error handling"""
    if not file_path or not os.path.exists(file_path):
        return
    
    try:
        os.remove(file_path)
        logger.info(f"Successfully cleaned up file: {file_path}")
    except PermissionError:
        logger.error(f"Permission denied when trying to delete file: {file_path}")
    except OSError as e:
        logger.error(f"OS error when trying to delete file {file_path}: {e}")
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"Unexpected error when trying to delete file {file_path}: {e}")
```

#### **4. Comprehensive Logging System:**
```python
# Configure logging
logging.basicConfig(
    level=logging.INFO,
    format='%(asctime)s - %(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s',
    handlers=[
        logging.FileHandler('blood_test_analyzer.log'),
        logging.StreamHandler()
    ]
)
logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
```

#### **5. LLM API Error Handling:**
```python
def run_comprehensive_analysis(query: str, file_path: str = "data/sample.pdf") -> str:
    """Run comprehensive blood test analysis with all medical specialists and error handling"""
    logger.info(f"Starting comprehensive analysis for query: {query[:50]}...")
    
    try:
        medical_crew = Crew(
            agents=[doctor, verifier, nutritionist, exercise_specialist],
            tasks=[document_verification, blood_test_analysis, nutrition_analysis, exercise_planning],
            process=Process.sequential,
            verbose=True
        )
        
        start_time = time.time()
        result = medical_crew.kickoff({'query': query})
        processing_time = time.time() - start_time
        
        logger.info(f"Analysis completed successfully in {processing_time:.2f} seconds")
        return str(result)
        
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"Error during crew analysis: {e}")
        raise ProcessingError(f"Analysis failed: {str(e)}")
```

#### **6. Enhanced Tool Error Handling (`tools.py`):**
```python
@tool("Blood Test Report Reader")
def read_blood_test_tool(path: str = 'data/sample.pdf') -> str:
    """Tool to read data from a pdf file from a path with comprehensive error handling"""
    logger.info(f"Attempting to read blood test report from: {path}")
    
    try:
        # Validate input path
        if not path or not isinstance(path, str):
            error_msg = "Invalid file path provided"
            logger.error(error_msg)
            return f"Error: {error_msg}"
        
        # Convert to Path object for better handling
        file_path = Path(path)
        
        # Check if file exists
        if not file_path.exists():
            error_msg = f"File not found: {path}"
            logger.error(error_msg)
            return f"Error: {error_msg}"
        
        # Check file extension, size, readability
        # ... comprehensive validation logic
        
    except FileNotFoundError:
        error_msg = f"File not found: {path}"
        logger.error(error_msg)
        return f"Error: {error_msg}"
    except PermissionError:
        error_msg = f"Permission denied accessing file: {path}"
        logger.error(error_msg)
        return f"Error: {error_msg}"
    except OSError as e:
        error_msg = f"OS error reading file {path}: {e}"
        logger.error(error_msg)
        return f"Error: {error_msg}"
    except Exception as e:
        error_msg = f"Unexpected error reading blood test report from {path}: {e}"
        logger.error(error_msg)
        return f"Error: {error_msg}"
```

#### **7. Tool Validation System:**
```python
def validate_tools() -> dict:
    """Validate all tools are working correctly"""
    validation_results = {
        "search_tool": False,
        "blood_test_reader": False,
        "nutrition_analyzer": False,
        "exercise_planner": False,
        "errors": []
    }
    
    # Test all tools and return comprehensive validation status
    # ... validation logic for each tool
```

#### **8. Enhanced FastAPI Endpoints:**
```python
@app.post("/analyze")
async def analyze_blood_report(
    file: UploadFile = File(...),
    query: str = Form(default="Please provide a comprehensive analysis of my blood test results")
):
    """Analyze blood test report with comprehensive error handling and validation"""
    
    file_path = None
    request_id = str(uuid.uuid4())
    logger.info(f"Analysis request {request_id} started for file: {file.filename}")
    
    try:
        # Step 1: Validate uploaded file
        validate_uploaded_file(file)
        
        # Step 2: Read and validate file content
        content = await file.read()
        validate_file_content(content, file.filename)
        
        # Step 3-7: Process with comprehensive error handling...
        
    except ValidationError:
        raise  # Handled by exception handler
    except ProcessingError:
        raise  # Handled by exception handler
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"Unexpected error in analyze_blood_report: {e}")
        raise HTTPException(
            status_code=status.HTTP_500_INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR,
            detail={
                "error": "Internal Server Error",
                "message": "An unexpected error occurred while processing your request",
                "request_id": request_id,
                "timestamp": time.time()
            }
        )
    finally:
        # Always clean up uploaded file
        if file_path:
            safe_file_cleanup(file_path)
```
